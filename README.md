# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `Working Demo`

The working application can be viewed at [https://getir-todo-assignment.herokuapp.com/].

We've preloaded some to-do list items using the demo API [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos]. 

### `Actions`
1. Add new items to your Todo list.
2. Edit the Todo item.
3. Delete the to-do item.
4. The status of a Todo item should be updated to completed and vice versa
5. You can choose whether to filter items by 'All', 'Completed', and 'Active'
6. Items are stored locally so they can be retrieved even when the page is refreshed.
